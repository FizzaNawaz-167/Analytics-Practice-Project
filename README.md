📊 Google Data Analytics Capstone Project: Cyclistic Case Study
🚴‍♂️ Project Overview
This project is part of the Google Data Analytics Certificate, where I analyze Cyclistic bike-share data to uncover user behavior patterns and provide business recommendations. The dataset includes trip details for casual and member riders, helping to answer key business questions.

📌 Business Task
The goal is to analyze Cyclistic's ride data to understand how different types of customers use the bike-sharing service. Based on the findings, the company aims to develop marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.

The dataset is publicly available and contains trip details such as:

Ride ID
Start and End Time
Start and End Station
Ride Type (Classic Bike, Docked Bike, Electric Bike)
